# devtools-angels

active angel investors in developer tools! For dev industry tracking see [sw-yx/tracking](https://github.com/sw-yx/tracking/blob/main/README.md). There is **no particular order** here but we hope we are high caliber [level 1](https://twitter.com/avichal/status/1132445996909092865?s=20) angels.

We share [dealflow in Discord](https://discord.gg/Zzqxwfge8W) for now but will also setup a dedicated newsletter soon.

  > I founded/sold Codeship and write angel + scout fund checks ($5-25K) in data or dev tool startups. First check or seed/A preferred. I don't care who else invests and geo is irrelevant as long as it's a reasonable legal entity. I can help best with everything product, go2market, company strategy, fundraising, and ceo/exec coaching. DM on Twitter is best for reaching out.

  > I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game — I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.

  > I’m a technologist. I studied CS at MIT and still write code. When I invest, I specifically look for technical founders building dev tools, API platforms, and “unloved” workflow cloud SaaS. I founded both Nylas and WorkOS and worked at Dropbox so this is an area I know well. My typical check size is around $100k but I can flex and get creative for bigger rounds too. If I invest, I will offer introductions to other investors I know (and like). This can help fill out a larger round. [more here](https://twitter.com/grinich/status/1357103610421673984?s=20)
